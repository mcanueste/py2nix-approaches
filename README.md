# py2nix-approaches

In this repository, we investigate current possible `py2nix` approaches for maintaining/developing python projects with `nix`.

Some methods tested will be from [this discourse post](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/status-of-lang2nix-approaches/14477/17).
Additionally, other available tools like `poetry2nix`, `pip2nix`, etc. will be tested as well.
